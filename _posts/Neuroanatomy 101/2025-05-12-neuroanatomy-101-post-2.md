# Brainstem

The brainstem is a CNS structure that acts as the highway for motor and sensory pathways travelling between the spinal cord and the cerebral cortex and houses important grey matter structures such as the nuclei for cranial nerves III to XI as well as the reticular activating system that is responsible for consciousness.

It is divided into three sections, rostral to caudal: the midbrain, the pons and the medulla.

Each section of the brainstem houses its own set of nuclei, tracts  and structures, and has its own signature look on cross-section, all of which serve as important landmarks on imaging.

# Midbrain

## Rostral midbrain

| Nuclei                   | Tracts                                             |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Superior colliculus      | Corticospinal tract (forming the cerebral peduncles) |
| Nucleus of CN3           | Spinal lemniscus (aka. spinothalamic tract)        |
| Substantia nigra         | Medial lemniscus (aka. Dorsal column)              |
| Edingerâ€“Westphal nucleus | *Sympathetic fibers*                               |

## Caudal midbrain

| Nuclei                                                                                | Tracts                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|Inferior Colliculus                                                                    | Corticospinal Tract (forming the cerebellar peduncles)|
